(** A module internal to [Core_bench]. Please look at {!Bench}.

    Some basic linear algebra code, so that basic operations can be done without
    introducing a dependency on Lacaml/LAPACK. Currently only has the minimum needed to do
    ordinary least squares.

    Matrices are represented via [float array array], in row-major order. *)

(** Vectors *)
module Vec : sig
  type t = float array [@@deriving sexp]

  (** Copy a vector *)
  val copy : t -> t

  (** [create0 len] sreate a vector of 0s of length [len]. *)
  val create0 : int -> t

  (** The sum of squares of entries in a vector *)
  val sumsq : t -> float

  (** The Euclidean length of a vector *)
  val norm : t -> float

  (** Comparison up to a tolerance for testing purposes. *)
  val almost_equal : tol:float -> t -> t -> bool
end

(** Matrices *)
module Mat : sig
  type t = float array array [@@deriving sexp]

  (** Copy a matrix *)
  val copy : t -> t

  (** Create a matrix of 0s *)
  val create0 : rows:int -> cols:int -> t

  val create_per_row : rows:int -> cols:int -> f:(int -> float) -> t

  (** Extract a column. Data is copied. Indices start at 0. *)
  val get_column : t -> int -> Vec.t

  (** Comparison up to a tolerance for testing purposes. *)
  val almost_equal : tol:float -> t -> t -> bool
end

(** [qr A] returns the QR-decomposition of [A] as a pair (Q,R). [A] must have at least as
    many rows as columns and have full rank.

    If [in_place] (default: [false]) is [true], then [A] is overwritten with [Q]. *)
val qr : ?in_place:bool -> Mat.t -> Mat.t * Mat.t

(** [triu_solve R b] solves R x = b where [R] is an m x m upper-triangular matrix and [b]
    is an m x 1 column vector. *)
val triu_solve : Mat.t -> Vec.t -> Vec.t Or_error.t

(** [mul_mv A x] computes the product [A * x] (where [M] is a matrix and [x] is a column
    vector). *)
val mul_mv : ?transa:bool -> Mat.t -> Vec.t -> Vec.t

(** [ols A b] computes the ordinary least-squares solution to A x = b. [A] must have at
    least as many rows as columns and have full rank.

    This can be used to compute solutions to non-singular square systems, but is somewhat
    sub-optimal for that purpose. The algorithm is to factor A = Q * R and solve R x = Q'
    b where Q' denotes the transpose of Q.

    If [in_place] (default: [false]) is [true], then [A] will be destroyed.

    With zero rows of data, the number of predictors is ambiguous; here the design
    decision is to succeed with an empty vector of coefficients. (This is in contrast to
    [Linear_algebra_wrapper.ols] which fails when it has zero data points.) *)
val ols : ?in_place:bool -> Mat.t -> Vec.t -> Vec.t Or_error.t
